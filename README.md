# 2023_smu_hackathon
Results: 2nd place

As part of the hackathon, my team was given data from the 2023 world happiness report summary and we were tasked with creating a compelling analysis within 24 hours. My group decided to combine this data with two additional datasets:
* 2023 Economist Development Index - from Wikipedia
* Age of Current government (as of 2023) - from Wikipedia

## Our Approach
* Research Question: How does political agency vs corruption impact happiness?
* Approach: We combined democracy scores, age of government, and perceptions of corruption to analyze happiness by country

## Results:
1. Examining the relationship between perceptions of corruption with democracy and happiness
